# Fake-News-Prediction
With the recent boom in the meda industry, a lot of fake news is circulating parallely with the real ones. I build a news prediction model that classifies news
as fake or real.<br>
The prediction is build using a Logisitic Regression Model which has an accuracy score of 97.90 %
